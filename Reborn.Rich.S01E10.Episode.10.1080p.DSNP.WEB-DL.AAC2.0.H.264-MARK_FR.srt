14
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,621

(Witness)

What's the settlement cost
for next month...

18
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,831
from the businesses
in the department store?

19
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,952
- 140 million dollars, ma'am.
- Make them into postdated checks.

20
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:15,872
- Sorry?
- I'm going to invest...

21
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,471
those 140 million dollars
into New Data Technology.

22
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:19,672
CEO Jin, that's the department store's...

23
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,672
I am Soonyang Department Store,

24
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:23,581
and Soonyang Department Store is me!

25
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,342
What's going on?
That is Director Im's voice.

26
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:27,831
- Director Im? Why?
- I have no idea.

27
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,081
Can anyone reach Director Im right now?

28
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,751
This recording was sent
to the Prosecutors' Office...

29
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:35,702
by Ms. Im Myeong Sook,
the former director of finance.

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,702
That was your voice, right?

31
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:45,181
So she secretly recorded our conversations?

32
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:48,373
Since when?

33
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:52,181
I believe this proves
that you are indeed guilty of embezzlement.

34
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,521
The false tip didn't come from Miracle.

35
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,592
It came from you, Ms. Jin.

36
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,601
(Episode 10)

37
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:16,981
As for Ms. Jin,

38
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,682
I'm afraid she'll be investigated
for embezzlement.

39
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,481
Did you say the prosecutors
obtained evidence...

40
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:27,321
from one of the directors
at the department store?

41
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,122
I apologize, sir.

42
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:38,062
When a dog bites its master,

43
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,302
whose fault is it?

44
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,692
Try all you want. 5 years? 10 years?

45
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:51,162
No. Even if I have to rot in prison
for 50 years,

46
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:54,252
I will not hand over my shares to you.

47
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,942
Then I guess you'll end up
rotting in prison,

48
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,421
and the department store stock
will become worthless.

49
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,811
If you fail to pay off
the promissory notes this month,

50
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,631
the department store will go bankrupt.

51
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,701
Then the creditors and banks
will be the ones...

52
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,661
liquidating the subsidiaries
that are of any worth.

53
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,222
If the group even had to lose
its subsidiaries because of you,

54
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,101
do you think
Grandfather would accept you back?

55
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,611
Thanks to you, Uncle Chang Je's
political career would be over too.

56
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:23,981
Do you think he'll have you back?

57
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:29,752
This is your last chance.
Hand over your shares.

58
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,241
Then I'll let you keep your dignity...

59
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:34,921
as Chairman Jin Yang Cheol's only daughter.

60
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,962
The prosecutors making you pose
in front of the cameras...

61
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,691
I do not want Grandfather to see that.

62
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:48,591
Hey, why me? Why Soonyang Department Store?

63
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,201
I have never wronged you in any way!

64
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:57,911
You taught me.

65
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:03,312
Don't you dare delude yourself
into thinking...

66
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,351
that you can be a rightful heir.

67
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:07,851
You guys...

68
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,361
are different...

69
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,432
from us.

70
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,661
That I'd never be the rightful heir
to Soonyang.

71
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,272
(Share Transfer Agreement)

72
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,342
Then I should buy it.

73
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,942
Like this.

(Reborn Rich)

77
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,621
It's an honour, sir.
Please allow me to escort you.

78
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,132
I heard you made
my one and only daughter...

79
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,331
cry her eyes out...

80
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,282
so you could make
this department store all yours.

81
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:42,512
But seeing how you hired
a management specialist...

82
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:46,452
Why? Do you not feel confident
about running it after all?

83
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,991
This furniture boutique's sales...

84
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:57,332
rose by 380 percent.

85
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,921
We believe it's because people
are finally...

86
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,801
getting married and moving
now that the economy is improving.

87
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,541
All right.

88
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,541
Since you joined us,
this furniture boutique...

89
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,012
has become one of
the best-performing shops.

90
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,351
Have you set the sales goal for next year?

91
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:19,372
What's the goal?

92
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,341
Various indexes that directly affect
furniture sales,

93
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,351
such as the country's birthrate
and marriage rate,

94
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,621
keep on dropping every year.

95
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:29,851
We should be as conservative
as possible when setting the goal...

96
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,371
Do Jun, you should get this CEO of yours
a pair of reading glasses.

97
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,342
I guess his eyesight is bad.
He can see one thing...

98
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,142
but not the other.

99
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,411
Pardon me?

100
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,562
Even if the population were to decrease,

101
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,111
the number of single-person households
will continue to rise.

102
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,851
At the moment, we struggle
to sell a couch to each household.

103
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,851
Soon, we'll be able to sell
a couch for each room.

104
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,092
What's your problem?
Do you not want to earn money?

105
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,361
I should've been more thoughtful, sir.

106
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,361
Please forgive me.

107
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,461
Get your calculations right.
Once you have set the sales target,

108
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,942
submit it to me.

109
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,531
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:19,961
How would you face your wife...

111
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,551
if you got fired
before your contract was up?

112
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,642
As for Ms. Jin...
It's not only circumstantial.

113
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,332
We have firm evidence that
she committed embezzlement.

114
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:37,182
Yet you want me to wrap it up
as a case of non-indictment?

115
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:40,481
What's the problem?
She paid back what she had embezzled.

116
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,132
- Sir.
- Prosecutor Seo.

117
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,142
You're young. Keep up with the trends,
will you?

118
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,512
The ability to think flexibly is important
in the 21st century.

119
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,702
I always thought it was such a shame
that we were settling...

120
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,401
for a punishment-focused justice system.

121
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,771
It's about time the prosecution...

122
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,652
contributed to paving the way
for reconciliation and forgiveness.

123
00:07:58,551 --> 00:12:03 NO CHANGE NEEDED

124
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,991
a total of 37 businesses went bankrupt,

125
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,632
and 946 people lost their jobs.

126
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:13,801
Has she compensated
the victims for their suffering?

127
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,871
Reconciliation and forgiveness?

128
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,501
Forcing the victims to forgive.

129
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,871
Do you call that restorative justice?

130
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:27,062
Aren't you doing this because
you wish to reconcile with Soonyang?

131
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:29,382
Look, Prosecutor Seo Min Yeong.

132
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:33,921
Prosecutors have the right
to prosecute crimes.

133
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:37,462
I'd like to exercise my rights
and indict Ms. Jin.

134
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:40,761
Please help me, sir.

135
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:47,901
Darn it.

136
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,472
This is why I don't like
working with women.

137
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,161
Hey, I bet you don't know...

138
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:58,412
why female prosecutors never get
the key positions.

139
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,161
You never served in the army,

140
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,552
so you don't know how to work
in an organization.

141
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:03,472
Article Seven
of the Prosecutors' Office Act.

142
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,781
The Principle of Identity
of Public Prosecutors. Don't you know?

143
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:07,541
"Obey any order of your superiors."

144
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,351
Just do as I say, you little brat!

145
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:17,162
I should get going.

146
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,352
- Grandfather.
- Yes, I'm fine.

147
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:23,572
- Are you all right?
- I'm totally fine.

148
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,351
- Here, have some water.
- What? Okay, thanks.

149
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,501
Hey, take a seat.

150
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,241
Okay.

151
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,312
Keep this to yourself, Do Jun.

152
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,391
The doctors at the medical center
wanted to run some tests on me,

153
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,722
so I took some X-rays.

154
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:24,162
What did the results say?
Are you undergoing treatment?

155
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,892
For others, only their organs show up
on their X-rays.

156
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:33,271
But below my chest, I have three things...

157
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:35,141
that others don't have.

158
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,561
Here resides my greed for money.

159
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,312
Here lies my distrust
of those who work for me.

160
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:43,381
And down here...

161
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:45,851
is where you'd find...

162
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,452
my ability...

163
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,292
to betray anyone,

164
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:55,462
anytime.

165
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,042
You see,

166
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:12,682
I grew Soonyang to what it is today
with those three things.

167
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,151
Did you say you wanted to buy Soonyang?

168
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:22,092
You won't be able to,

169
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,292
if all you've got
is what everyone else has.

170
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,741
Let them...

171
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,342
do the work.

172
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,241
But...

173
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:49,912
never trust them.

174
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,151
Hwa Young ended up in that mess
because she trusted her employees.

175
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,861
Do not trust anyone.

176
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,672
Do not open up to anyone.

177
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:14,342
If you do, it'll end up...

178
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,641
becoming nothing but your weakness.

179
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,151
You little rascal.

180
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:29,592
I'm off.

181
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,892
Then I may distrust you...

182
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:43,432
and betray you too, Grandfather.

183
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:49,342
Will that be okay?

184
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:57,251
Do Jun.

185
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,192
Do you think...

186
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,922
I trust you?

187
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,901
Oh, dear.

188
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,861
The case has been reassigned
to a different prosecutor.

189
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:44,462
It's obvious.

190
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,302
You're a woman of principle.

191
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,731
You'd never blindly obey Chief,

192
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,802
so I bet this was the only way.

193
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,981
I know you worked hard on the case.

194
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,011
I'm sorry this happened.

195
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:05,151
This means I won't have
to work late for a while. This is great.

196
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,192
Well, since we have nothing to do today,

197
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,521
why don't we leave
right on the dot for once?

198
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,222
Like other civil servants.

199
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:15,731
Bye, I'm off.

200
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:31,381
Let's meet up.

201
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:48,131
You knew from the get-go.

202
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,622
That I wouldn't be able
to indict Jin Hwa Young...

203
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:54,731
and that I'd have no choice
but to let it go.

204
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:58,172
I had never once heard from you...

205
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:00,972
until you suddenly showed up
and tipped me off.

206
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,842
From beginning to end,

207
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,442
you used me.

208
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:09,682
You knew from the get-go...

209
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,021
that I didn't tip you off
for the sake of law and order.

210
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:16,512
- Hey, that's...
- "Let me use..."

211
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,462
"a third-generation heir
to realize justice."

212
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,332
That's what you said. Don't you remember?

213
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,871
Hey, why... You really do have a way
with words.

214
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,501
Do you take special lessons?

215
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:33,871
Do you take special lessons?

216
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:36,511
You're quite eloquent.

217
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:41,042
It is you.

218
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,212
The Seo Min Yeong I know.

219
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:46,722
Don't make that face.

220
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,462
Those eyes and that face,
as if you know everything about me.

221
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,322
Don't do that.

222
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,662
I nearly bought...

223
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:01,302
your lie.

224
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,412
I'll become a great prosecutor?

225
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:10,561
When my boss told me
I'd never be able to return...

226
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,712
to the Central Office
if I got transferred because of this,

227
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,481
I couldn't even say anything...

228
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:17,952
because I didn't want to grow old
as a mediocre civil servant...

229
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:20,002
who had to pack up every two years...

230
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,322
to transfer from a small-town office
to another.

231
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,462
I'm so cowardly and materialistic.

232
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,391
You think I'll be a good prosecutor?

233
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,072
I bet you have no idea how sly I can be.

234
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,141
When they reassigned the case
to someone else to reprimand me,

235
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:43,542
everyone else in the office
was worried about me.

236
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:49,582
But the truth is, I was so relieved...

237
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,381
because it meant that
no one would ever find out...

238
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,121
how cowardly and servile I was...

239
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,261
in front of my boss.

240
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:16,212
Why are you telling me all this?

241
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,182
I wonder too.

242
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,251
I always let you see right through me.

243
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:29,722
From the very beginning...

244
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:35,132
I should get going before I give more away.

245
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,261
I won't be a great prosecutor,

246
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:42,602
which means...

247
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:45,202
you lied to me.

Oh, my.

Isn't he so cool?

- This feels so surreal.

I lied to you?

Let's go.

262
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,362

00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,862
I lied to you?

The Seo Min Yeong I know...

272
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,352
will become a great prosecutor.
I'm sure of it.

273
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:46,511
I told you to stop making that face.

274
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:28,812
The foreign exchange crisis,
also known as the IMF crisis...

275
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:30,112
that occurred 3 years 8 months ago...

276
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,021
has officially ended today.

277
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,981
We have officially graduated...

278
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,681
from IMF.

279
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,132
Once again, I deeply express my gratitude.

280
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,822
Babies' first-birthday rings
and wedding rings came out...

281
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,071
of wardrobes,

282
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:45,301
and people collected dollars cooperatively.

283
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:48,862
But as corporate restructuring started...

284
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,461
due to sovereign default,

285
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,582
jobless and homeless people
increased exponentially.

286
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:54,761

287
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,751
and repaying the IMF debt
of 19.5 billion dollars today,

288
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,572
the economic indicators...

289
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:01,171
such as foreign exchange reserve increase
improved,

290
00:23:01,251 --> 00:02:40,441
and foreigner investors
have returned as well.

291
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:07,192
Does this make sense?

292
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:12,251
The redemption period Korea promised IMF...

293
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,981
was 2004, which is 3 years later.

294
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,951
Nobody from Wall Street expected Korea...

295
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,301
to repay the debt this fast.

296
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,301
Can you explain this?

297
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:22,841
Didn't you know?

298
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,332
It is Koreans' hobby to overcome
a national crisis.

299
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,311
No. What I mean is,

300
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:31,872
how could you have been the only one
who predicted this accurately?

301
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,051
Just like when IMF started.

302
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,692
Do you know what's the strangest?

303
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,362
You don't get excited at all.

304
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,211
If I were you, I wouldn't be here.

If the world moved as I predicted,

306
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,451
I would have died
from my heart exploding...

307
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:49,202
or would have been jailed
for leading a cult.

308
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,301
Calm down.

309
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:57,041
How can you stay so calm at that age?

You need to keep your cool
when evaluating a performance.

I looked into it with a cool head.

317
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,932
Wouldn't the president
who even won the Nobel Peace Prize...

318
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:25,661
want to secure
the title of finishing IMF early...

319
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:28,001
no matter what?

320
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:30,511
- Especially before...
- The presidential election.

321
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:31,811
the presidential election next year.

322
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:33,412
So?

323
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:36,781
As expected,
all economic policies were focused...

324
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:39,122
on securing dollars.

325
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:42,642
By opening the market to foreign investors?

326
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:43,722
Yes.

327

329
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,632
And that will be...

330
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:54,862
a good opportunity...

331
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,472

Everyone, good job paying off
the country's debt.

334
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,991
So what if the country paid off the debt?

335
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:24,282

336
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:26,402
to meet the standard of the IMF.

337

How can we do business
when the bank loan rate is so high?

338
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,961
Immediate cash flow is more important...

339
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,771
than companies' growth potential.

340
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:41,112
Do you know what this means?

341
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,952
The manufacturing industries are now dead.

342
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,051

a moneylending business to survive.

Not manufacturing, but finance.

344
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,892

you mean...

00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:12,011
Soonyang Investment, Card,
Insurance, Savings and so on.

354
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,162
to Soonyang Insurance?

355
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:30,862
To set up a financial holding company
separate from manufacturing?

356
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:36,352
It was unexpected of him...

357
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:38,231
to set up Soonyang Financial
Holding Company.

358
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,741
Chairman Jin finally made a move.

359
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,231
He went against the political regulation,

360
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,382
the separation of industrial
and financial capital.

361
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:49,912
That's merely a justification.

362
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:53,182
He's thinking of something else
on the inside.

363
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,091
Did you not hear what Direct Jung
of the medical center say?

364
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:00,911
There's a time bomb...

365
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:04,432
in my father's head.

366
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:07,962
There's a reason he is in a rush.

367
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:00,202
- Then why...
- Think about it.

368
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:14,062
What will happen if Soonyang Financial
Holding Company...

369
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,741
secures just five percent
of Soonyang Corporation?

370
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:20,041
It can exert influence
on every manufacturing affiliate...

371
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:22,751
- under Soonyang Corporation.
- Bingo.

372
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:25,551
The owner
of the financial holding company...

373
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:30,922
will become the owner of Soonyang Group.

374
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:34,291
(Daily Report
on Executive Manager Jin Seong Jun)

375
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,352
It would be perfect for Seong Jun
to take a position...

376
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,902
in the financial holding company.

377
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:55,811
Hyeon Min is doing her best every day.

378
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,212
To soothe your anger.

379
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:03,051
Seong Jun repented a lot
for the past two years.

380
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:08,162
Look, Father.

381
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:12,261
(Daily Report
on Executive Manager Jin Seong Jun)

382
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,352
He's getting along really well
with the employees...

383
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,231
and is down-to-earth...

384
00:28:18,472 --> 00:28:20,642
that most employees don't know...

385
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,712
that he is your eldest grandson.

386
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,811
The distribution warehouse
has the highest sales as well.

387
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,652
You're right.

388
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,682
He's getting along well.

389
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,021
Tell him to stay there.

390
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:42,091
It suits him perfectly.

391
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,862
I'm too ashamed to see Hyeon Min,
that's why.

392
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:51,071
Father, please.

393
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:54,972
Welcome.

394
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,672
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

395
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:01,112
Hello, Hyeon Min.

396
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:03,412
You're here, Aunt Ji Na.

397
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,751
Why do you look so dull?

398
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,122
Living with your in-laws must be hard.

399
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:11,211
Tell me about it.
You have both mother-in-law...

400
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,991
and grandmother-in-law.

401
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,681
Your grandmother-in-law is difficult,

402
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:19,061
and your mother-in-law is fussy.

403
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,632
On top of that,

404
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,402
your aunt-in-law is rude.

405
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:26,771
- Jeong Rae.
- Hyeon Min.

406
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,691
How are you managing
your facial expression...

407
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:30,892
that you get such a comment?

408
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,712
Remember you're living
with your grandparents-in-law.

409
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:34,501
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:37,032
Why are you scolding her?

411
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:38,701
I'm the one you dislike.

412
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:39,922
You know that well.

413
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,392
If you have anything to say to her,
tell me instead.

414
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,142
- Okay.
- She's already having it hard...

415
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,382
with her in-laws.
You don't need to add to that.

416
00:29:49,462 --> 00:29:50,491
Sure.

417
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:59,142
Why would you take your sorrow
of not having a son out on her?

418
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:04,241
If I talk to you,

419
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,442
would you even understand?

420
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,581
A special exhibition of Yun Hyong Keun...

421
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,612
and Park Seo Bo will be held
at Hyeon Min's gallery,

422
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:17,692
so I wanted to buy some paintings.

423
00:30:17,821 --> 00:02:19,521
Do you even know...

424
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,061
what monochrome painting...

425
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,491
or abstract art is?

426
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:27,031
What about pointillism?

427
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:29,632
The only art you know...

428
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:33,672
is the oriental art on your cushion.

429
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,521
- Are you done talking?
- Yes.

430
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,212
What...

431
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,501
What are you doing? You're so uncultured!

432
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:18,642
Yes! I'm the daughter
of a private loan market's financer,

433
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:21,352
and you're the daughter
of a finance minister.

434
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,722
Seong Jun is going through
this hardship because of you!

435
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:27,962
What do you think you are doing?

436
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,202
Your father is here.

437
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:42,112
Mother.

438
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:45,341
Jeong Rae.

439
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,212
Did you do this to her?

440
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:53,182
It's me, Grandmother. I did it.

441
00:31:57,392 --> 00:31:59,812
Excuse me, bring the cleaning equipment.

442
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:00,922
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,311
You did?

444
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:20,241
I stumbled while
I was walking down the stairs.

445
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,081
I'm sorry for making a fuss.

446
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:27,222
Are you okay, Aunt Ji Na?

447
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:29,491
Hyeon Min.

448
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,991
Come to my gallery.

449
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,261
I'll give you a nice painting as a present.

450
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,681
Mother really liked
the monochrome paintings...

451
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,231
of Painter Park Seo Bo as well.

452
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:44,771
Because she could feel
the ascetic life of the painter.

453
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,811
Do you think this makes sense?

454
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,341
You know Jung Hee Gu,
the multi-level financial scammer?

455
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:30,952
I just came back
from interviewing the victim,

456
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:32,852
and it's a total nightmare for them.

457
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,272
She invested 250,000 dollars...

458
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:35,542
which was her daughter's death benefit,

459
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:36,892
but she couldn't get back a cent.

460
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:39,342
But Jung Hee Gu, that jerk,

461
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,862
won't even get punished because
he died in Southeast Asia.

462
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:45,962
Imagine how wronged she feels.
It was her daughter's death benefit.

463
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:47,261
Don't you think so?

464
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,102
I see.

465
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:51,472
You worked hard.

466
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,142
Being late for 40 minutes is not bad.

467
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,712
Thank you.

468
00:34:05,682 --> 00:34:07,981
I know you're late
from listening to her story.

469
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,191
So stop being sorry, and let's eat.

470
00:34:13,722 --> 00:34:15,591
When did you order?

471
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,662
Just now.

472
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:19,702
When you were running
and fixing your makeup.

473
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,301
I don't get it.

474
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:24,732
What do you mean?

475
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,972
Why do you need to fix your makeup
when you're pretty?

476
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:31,841
Eat up.

477
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:36,682
Thank you.

478
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,821
What a world.

479
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:50,191
The damage was over four billion dollars,

480
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,832
and there were
over 70,000 innocent victims.

481
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,002
But in the end,

482
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,932
the case was closed for not having
the authority to file prosecution.

483
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:00,142
Capital market runs...

484
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,772
on an appropriate amount
of ignorance and greed.

485
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:14,082
Is Miracle Investment
in that market as well?

486
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:22,162
Why? Are you worried?

487
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:29,732
That I might stand in front of you
as a suspect?

488
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,522
You know New Data Technology, right?

489
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,722
I heard it was under investigation.

490
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:56,852
They are investigating accounting fraud...

491
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:58,832
and matched orders.

492
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,332
We received a complaint.

493
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,652
A third-generation conglomerate
family member...

494
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,502
is one of the people
who manipulated stock prices.

495
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,372
The rich are always greedier.

496
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:11,292
Prosecutor Seo, take charge
of the case from search and seizure.

497
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:12,642
It's a sensitive matter.

498
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:15,982
It says whose son he is, right?

499
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,252
They wrote the news
without checking the facts?

500
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:24,911
Which newspaper company is it?

501
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,642
Hyunsung Daily released it
on the internet first...

502
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,191
saying it's exclusive news.

503
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,482
Hyunsung Daily?

504
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,502
Now, evening economic newspapers
will follow suit...

505
00:36:32,702 --> 00:36:34,702
and 9pm news
will become their speakers.

506
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:37,272
Look.

Turns Out to Be an Operation")

("New Data Technology's Jackpot Story
Turns Out to Be an Operation")

509
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,611
What operation? Does this make sense? Me?

510
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:49,952
We're dragged into their operation.

511
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,781
Darn it.

00:36:53,051 --> 00:36:55,402
We're from the prosecution.
Stop what you're doing...

513
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,622
and get up from your seat.

514
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,522

at Seoul District

00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:29,712
We received a complaint
saying Miracle Investment...

518
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,591
was systematically involved
in the stock price manipulation...

519
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,361
of New Data Technology.

520
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:36,932

(Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office)

522
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:50,441
Will you cooperate?

523
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:57,852
Based on the information you tipped off,

524
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,551
the prosecution is investigating.

525
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:02,722
Isn't it strange?

526
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,022
Do Jun...

527
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:08,381
sold off all of his shares
of New Data Technology...

528
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,832
right before the stock price plummeted.

529
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:12,212
As if he knew...

530
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:16,002
what was going to happen after that.

531
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:22,071
Internal trading using private information?

532
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:27,611
He was able to set a perfect trap
for my wife because of that too?

533
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:30,711
Oh, dear.

534
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,752
Anyway,

535
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,051
deal with him well...

536
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,642
so that Hwa Young doesn't feel wronged.

537
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:39,761
But...

538
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:42,511
it is against the securities exchange act,

539
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:43,932
but it won't be easy.

540
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:47,181
It's always hard to prove that
they used internal information...

541
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:50,631
at the point of trading.

542
00:38:51,602 --> 00:38:52,941
Does that matter?

543
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,472
A trial doesn't only take place in court.

544
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:01,361
I see.

545
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,832
Why did he manipulate the stock price?
What does he lack?

546
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:05,531
Why did the stock price drop
so drastically?

547
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,281
("Third-Generation Heir Laughing
Behind Small Investors' Tears")

548
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:10,341
The family of a conglomerate
is killing off all the small investors.

549
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,571
(Small Investors, Gather Here!)

550
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,022
(The Culprit Behind New Data Technology
Stock Price Manipulation)

551
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:18,551
An official says other than Mr. Jin
of a certain company,

552
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:21,781
three more heirs of conglomerates
are suspected to be involved,

553
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,522
but it is not easy to prove
the charge against them,

554
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:26,642
so they cannot investigate openly.

555
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:27,972
The stock price manipulation...

556
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:43,151
Are you holding a court
of public opinion first?

557
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:45,752
When the prosecutor in charge just started?

558
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:48,392
Am I that unreliable?

559
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:50,451
Or are you not confident of this case?

560
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:52,111
He's the third-generation heir of Soonyang.

561
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:53,451
Public opinion must boil up...

562
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:54,781
so that we can keep our pace
until the trial.

563
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,252
You're relying
on whimsical public opinion...

564
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,631
because you're afraid of Soonyang?

565
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,991
You're a prosecutor, at that.
How embarrassing.

566
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:03,071
Hey, Prosecutor Seo.

567
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:05,142
You...

568
00:40:07,912 --> 00:40:09,772
- What?
- Starting tomorrow morning,

569
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:11,812
don't share internal information
with reporters in a sauna.

570
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,321
Publication of facts of suspected crime
is strictly illegal.

571
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:18,122
I'm going to...

572
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,421
do my best...

573
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:22,361
and investigate the case thoroughly...

574
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,091
so that the judgement of law
will be enough.

575
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,502
Why you little...

576
00:40:34,272 --> 00:40:36,931
It's not true.

577
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:39,091
I mean it. We're not involved.

578
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:41,161
It's a temporary issue.

579
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,002
That news is fake.

580
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:44,232
Hold on.

581
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:47,201
I'm going to repeat what you just said.

582
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,051
You want to cancel...

583
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:52,421
Of course. I will return your investment
according to the process.

584
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:55,062
Miracle Investment
won't be shaken just from this.

585
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:58,152
As you know, there aren't
many investment companies...

586
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:00,261
in the market
that makes as much profit as us.

587
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,071
Okay. I'm hanging up.

588
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:10,542
I gave it a thought.

589
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,931
They attacked us
with New Data Technology...

590
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,711
and even moved the prosecution,

591
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:18,852
so I thought it was CEO Jin Hwa Young
taking revenge.

592
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:21,582
But no.

593
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,971
They know about the flow
of our stock trading in detail.

594
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,151
- That means...
- Yes.

595
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:29,691
It's Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki
of Soonyang Investment.

596
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:31,031
If you meet him, tell him...

597
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:32,732
that his operation was successful.

598
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:39,071
How many people want...

599
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:41,171
their investment returned?

600
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:46,142
For rich people, security is as important
as the rate of return.

601
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,211
A scandal like this...

602
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,352
- is critical.
- Exactly.

603
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:55,551
How much is it?

604
00:41:58,191 --> 00:41:59,222
Hello, sir.

605
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:00,642
Is Grandfather upstairs?

606
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:01,792
- Yes.
- Thank you.

607
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:19,341
Grandfather is very worried about you.

608
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:22,832
I'm finding out...

609
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:24,381
just how strong Hyunsung Daily is.

610
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:28,321
If you need my help, tell me anytime.

611
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,022
We're family.

612
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:37,261
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

613
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,102
You should go inside.
The elders must be waiting.

614
00:42:57,151 --> 00:02:59,151 NO CHANGE NEEDED

615
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:02,352
Well...

616
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:06,461
I never considered stock manipulation,
Grandfather.

617
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,991
What I made from New Data Technology...

618
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:14,261
was just average by Miracle's standards.

619
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:17,071
Then...

620
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:20,542
is this innocent kid...

621
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:24,642
being harassed by the joint forces
of the media and prosecution?

622
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:26,482
My own grandson?

623
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:31,082
They should know better.

624
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:34,542
Do you want me to call Director Park
at the Central Prosecutors' Office?

625
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:37,611
You can't do that, not in this day and age.

626
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:39,341
Just one missed call from you...

627
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:42,491
will make them say we're invading
their right to investigate.

628
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,261
Is that what you want them to say,
Father?

629
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:49,732
Right now,

630
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:55,441
the investigation isn't what Do Jun
should be worrying about.

631
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:59,171
Miracle's investors are calling,
demanding refunds.

632
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,142
They want their money back.

633
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,312
It'll be too much for him
to handle on his own.

634
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:09,642
Miracle must handle
a massive amount of cash.

635
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,471
He can't retrieve it all immediately.

636
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:14,111
How much longer
do you think he can survive...

637
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:15,792
without an influx of capital?

638
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:21,401
What do you think will happen
if he can't return the investments?

639
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,832
Soonyang will be the one to take the hit.

640
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:28,002
They'll say the financial market
isn't a playground for the rich.

641
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:31,671
Then what?

642
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:34,042
Do you have a solution?

643
00:44:39,821 --> 00:44:41,952
Miracle Investment...

644
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:46,051
Soonyang Investment
will acquire the company.

645
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:50,792
Let's turn it into a PR coup, Father.

646
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:58,732
An uncle who took responsibility
for his nephew's errors.

647
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:03,792
If Soonyang gets involved,
the investors will calm down,

648
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,671
and they'll stop demanding a refund.

649
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:08,261
If Soonyang Investment takes over Miracle,

650
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:11,131
financial authorities
will stop complaining we're amassing...

651
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:14,421
a slush fund or that we must
be investigated for tax evasion.

652
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,332
It makes sense.

653
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,472
- Grandfather...
- Dong Ki.

654
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,171
Then...

655
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,372
you'd better pay Do Jun...

656
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:43,111
the right price.

657
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:44,651
Yes.

658
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:46,852
Good.

659
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:49,952
That's done.

660
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:52,921
Grandfather.

661
00:45:54,222 --> 00:45:56,361
All I need right now is time.

662
00:45:56,732 --> 00:46:00,031
Once the prosecutors realize
I didn't manipulate the stock price,

663
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:03,232
everything will go back to normal.

664
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:07,702
You don't have to worry about Miracle.

665
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:09,341
Come on.

666
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,671
I'm not worried about you.

667
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:17,651
It's Soonyang, that I'm worried about.

668
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:21,022
Okay?

669
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:39,301
Right now, we need 480 million.
There's no other way.

670
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:42,301
The Soonyang Department Store
and Ahjin Motors shares we own.

671
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,261
We have to sell them all.

672
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,082
There's no guarantee
we can liquidate it all.

673
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:48,511
In the current market,

674
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:51,431
finding someone
with that much buying power...

675
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:52,832
will take time.

676
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:55,252
What if we take longer
and miss the repayment deadline?

677
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,421
That could cause a massive delay.

678
00:46:58,222 --> 00:46:59,222
Darn it.

679
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:02,421
Will you say something? Anything.

680
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,292
I'm getting frustrated over here.

681
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:07,732
If I speak up,

682
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:11,571
will you two do as I say?

683
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:21,902
There can be no issues
with the repayment schedule.

684
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:24,252
No delay, suspension,
or legal restrictions.

685
00:47:24,752 --> 00:47:27,741
Because then,
Jin Yang Cheol will get involved...

686
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:29,911
and won't stop at anything
to feed Miracle...

687
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:31,142
to Soonyang Investment.

688
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:32,341
So what?

689
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:33,991
The overseas shares Miracle invested in.

690
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:36,432
Liquidate them all.

691
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:42,031
Rachael. How much will that
be worth in today's exchange rate?

692
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,631
You want to bring that money in now?

693
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,422
When prosecutors are watching...

694
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:49,441
this black-haired foreigner so closely?

695
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:52,732
Wake up. We'll never see a cent of it
if you do that.

696
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:54,482
They'll take it all saying it's tax.

697
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:56,312
Wouldn't that be a waste?

698
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:59,571
Those overseas shares
ensured us a stable profit...

699
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:00,752
over the past five years.

700
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:04,022
Mr. Oh.

701
00:48:04,792 --> 00:48:07,522
Do you remember what I said to you
five years ago in the US?

702
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:09,892
I asked you...

703
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:16,232
to turn my hunch into data and profits.

704
00:48:17,502 --> 00:48:19,772
This is the only option I can think of.

705
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:25,571
Retrieve everything
we invested overseas. Please.

706
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:36,122
To uproot Do Jun completely,

707
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:38,892
this is the perfect timing.

708
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:43,991
According to numerology,

709
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:46,732
Do Jun's time and date of birth clash
with the current time.

710
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:49,102
The negative energy,

711
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,671
the misfortune index has doubled.

712
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,102
What's the clash?

713
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:57,011
Figuratively,
"a tiger bites and you bleed."

714
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:59,571
In other words,
you will die an unnatural death.

715
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:02,011
He'll die away from home.

716
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,312
The one issue is,

717
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,252
if you factor in his date of birth,

718
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,812
if he manages to overcome
the tiger's deadly bite,

719
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:13,321
he can attain riches and fame
beyond that of anyone else's.

720
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:16,662
So I must not miss out this time?

721
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:22,202
I must do whatever I can
to make Miracle mine.

722
00:49:23,202 --> 00:49:24,531
Make the call.

723
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:29,171
Tell that guy to bring me
Do Jun's investment portfolio.

724
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,611
- Sir.
- Yes?

725
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,781
Do you think the prosecutors
could find Do Jun guilty?

726
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:44,122
I'm a businessman.

727
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:46,272
If you make money, you're innocent.

728
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:48,622
If you lose money,
you're guilty. That's it.

729
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,202
Mr. Lee. Do you know...

730
00:49:54,332 --> 00:49:58,002
what's most important
in the capital market?

731
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:01,872
- No.
- The IMF said...

732
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:06,392
- it's the global standard.
- What?

733
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:09,031
Work like a dog to spend like a mogul.

734
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:12,051
That's the Korean standard.

735
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,752
The global standard says
we must earn like a mogul too.

736
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:18,792
Without getting dirty.

737
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:20,921
While observing the law.

738
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,091
And being moral.

739
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:29,301
The capital market
won't consider Do Jun as a mogul.

740
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,441
He's dirty all over.

741
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:38,332
Is that why you agreed...

742
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,441
to let Mr. Jin Dong Ki take over Miracle?

743
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,642
Dong Ki is good with numbers.

744
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,571
He pushed aside
Heavy Machinery and Chemicals...

745
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:48,551
to take over the investment
and insurance business.

746
00:50:48,752 --> 00:50:51,122
If the picture he wants
to paint is the same as mine,

747
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,392
it wouldn't be a bad idea...

748
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:58,631
for Dong Ki to take my seat.

749
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,702
The financial holding company.

750
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:04,401
Will you give it to him?

751
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:21,082
(Miracle Investment's Overseas
Investment Portfolio)

752
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,651

753
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:32,292
So...

754
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:35,881
Miracle's incredible rate of earnings...

755
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:37,631
was due to overseas shares?

756
00:51:38,071 --> 00:51:39,232
Yes, sir.

757
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:41,272
And these are what they invested in?

758
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:45,711
Give it to him.

759
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,991
- I'll leave now, sir.
- Okay.

760
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:02,491
- I expect a lot from you.
- Okay. Thank you.

761
00:52:16,142 --> 00:52:17,312
I know that...

762
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:23,781
a terrible tragedy
that no one can even imagine...

763
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:26,952
is about to happen.

764
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,301
What happened
when I was a child in my other life.

765
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:44,292
If it were me,
I'd back Roh Tae Woo's campaign.

766
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:46,591
Kim Young Sam
and Kim Dae Jung of the Democratic Party...

767
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:50,161
decided against single candidacy
earlier today.

768
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:52,962
An aircraft with 95 passengers
and 20 flight attendants...

769
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:55,332
went missing above Yangon, Myanmar.

770
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:58,182
They also most definitely happen
in my current lifetime...

771
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,952
of Jin Do Jun.

772
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,392
As if mocking...

773
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:09,122
my efforts and desires.

774
00:53:11,432 --> 00:53:14,301
They most definitely happen.

775
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:20,602
All I can do...

776
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:25,441
is to make my own choices.

777
00:53:34,551 --> 00:53:36,502
This just came in.

778
00:53:36,582 --> 00:53:38,611
You're looking at a clearly
very disturbing live shot there.

779
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:41,011
A plane has crashed
into one of the towers...

780
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,821
of the World Trade Center this morning.

781
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:52,772
What effects do we expect?

782
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:54,361
How much will we lose?

783
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:57,091
Between 10 to 15 for KOSDAQ, 17 for KOSPI.

784
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,761
Korea's stock market
will open three hours later tomorrow.

785
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:00,582
The US market will be closed for four days.

786
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:02,062
As soon as it opens tomorrow,

787
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:04,172
people will sell
in a panic across all industries.

788
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:06,332
Call the fund managers and traders.

789
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:08,471
Tell them to sell
the prices-sensitive stocks first.

790
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:10,341
Have them on standby three hours ahead!

791
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:11,452
Yes, sir.

792
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:22,832
Sir. There's another more pressing issue.

793
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:25,002
The shares you bought in New York...

794
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:27,102
that were in Miracle's portfolio.

795
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:30,111
Airlines, hotels, travel agencies,
and insurance companies.

796
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:33,642
They're businesses that'll suffer
the most after this incident.

797
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,182
A loss is inevitable.

798
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,011
You punk!

799
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:43,852
This is all on you.

800
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:47,381
You said Do Jun is lucky with money!

801
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:48,461
I apologize, sir.

802
00:54:53,732 --> 00:54:55,761
Scrape together all the money we have.

803
00:54:56,901 --> 00:54:58,571
As soon as the market opens tomorrow,

804
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:01,202
buy put options.

805
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:02,892
Put options?

806
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:05,241
They're designed
to protect you against a loss!

807
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,781
Even if the stock market crashes,

808
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:12,252
I will survive and get out somehow.

809
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:20,091
No, right?

810
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:26,392
Young expat,
you didn't know this would happen.

811
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,292
How could you have known?

812
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,502
Not even the FBI or CIA knew.

813
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:35,142
It was the only option...

814
00:55:36,642 --> 00:55:38,111
we could choose.

815
00:55:39,412 --> 00:55:41,542
It was a terrorist attack
in the center of New York.

816
00:55:42,082 --> 00:55:45,611
No one can say when Wall Street
will recover from the shock.

817
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:47,642
If we hadn't done...

818
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:50,372
what you'd said and didn't sell our shares
in the overseas markets...

819
00:55:50,452 --> 00:55:51,522
Mr. Oh.

820
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:53,861
To all the victims of this attack,

821
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:56,421

823
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:07,171
Why don't we buy some put options?

824
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:10,611
The market will crash
for the next few days.

825
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:13,841
We made a lot from selling
all we had in the New York market.

826
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:15,982
When the market opens tomorrow,

827
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:19,211
people will try to sell whatever they own.

828
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:22,622
I'll buy up some blue-chip stocks.

829
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,051
You'll go against the tide?

830
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:29,461
If you buy put options
that bet the market will crash,

831
00:56:31,131 --> 00:56:32,491
we could make some money.

832
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,461
Because that's going with the flow.

833
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,602

834
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:41,372

after just one month?

890
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,285
Where are all the people who said
there'd be a war?

891
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:26,736
How come everything is so peaceful?

892
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:29,256
(Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki)

893
00:59:30,116 --> 00:59:32,685
The US lowered the interest rate,
improving liquidity.

894
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:36,995
Future stocks sold at a record high,

895
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,286
so the ten million dollars you invested
in put options...

896
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:41,535
in case the market crashed...

897
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:43,435
was lost.

898
00:59:46,205 --> 00:59:49,805
No one could have foreseen this kind
of bull market.

899
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:51,826
Miracle Investment's Buy Miracle fund.

900
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:55,176
Who could've thought they'd create
such a dramatic turnaround...

901
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:57,075
in the Korean market?

902
00:59:57,785 --> 01:00:00,015
Why you...

903
01:00:03,855 --> 01:00:05,955
Sir, you have a visitor.

904
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:19,305
Hello, Mr. Baek.

905
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:21,906
Thank you.

906
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:29,046
Hello, Uncle.

907
01:00:35,086 --> 01:00:36,256
"Buy Miracle?"

908
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:38,775
You scraped together
what little you had to launch...

909
01:00:38,855 --> 01:00:40,446
a successful fund,

910
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:43,855
and you're acting like a victorious hero.

911
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,225
Do you think I don't know? You also...

912
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:50,866
You lost just as much as I did.

913
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:52,725
The airlines, travel agencies,
hotels, and insurance companies...

914
01:00:52,805 --> 01:00:55,406
you'd invested in through
the New York Stock Exchange.

915
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,196
Do you think I don't know
you lost all that...

916
01:00:58,276 --> 01:00:59,645
in the 9-11 terrorist attacks?

917
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:02,145
Oh, that?

918
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:06,935
New York Air, the Lavender Hotel chain,

919
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:09,055
Seventy Insurance, and Tour Eagles?

920
01:01:11,256 --> 01:01:12,325
How odd.

921
01:01:13,256 --> 01:01:15,825
Miracle's investment portfolio
is top secret.

922
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:19,665
How do you know all that?

923
01:01:26,765 --> 01:01:30,105
You can't let in a neighbourâ€™s dog
just because they're cute.

924
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:34,946
You're the one who'll lose out.

925
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:39,946
You punk!

926
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:53,796
Why did you come here?

927
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,805
Did you come here to lecture me?

928
01:01:59,265 --> 01:02:00,336
No.

929
01:02:01,975 --> 01:02:03,276
I'm here to buy...

930
01:02:04,946 --> 01:02:05,975
Soonyang Investment.

931
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:09,245
What?

932
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:23,995
Regardless of the country's economy,

933
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:26,225
regardless of whether your customers
lose their savings,

934
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:28,815
you're praying the market will crash...

935
01:02:28,895 --> 01:02:30,265
when you're
the head of an investment company.

936
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:33,336
I can't let you stay in charge any longer.

937
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:39,176
Do Jun.

938
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:43,716
Do Jun!

939
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:49,086
Do you think...

940
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:52,355
the world will go the way you want?

941
01:02:57,596 --> 01:02:58,665
Of course not.

942
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:01,435
Oh, right.

943
01:03:02,966 --> 01:03:05,585
The National Pension, Teachers' Pension,

944
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:07,265
and Pension and Funds Bureau...

945
01:03:07,676 --> 01:03:10,805
decided to cut ties
with Soonyang Investment.

946
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:14,375
What?

947
01:03:15,245 --> 01:03:18,645
Oh, you didn't know?

948
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:29,716
You lost over ten million dollars...

949
01:03:29,796 --> 01:03:31,566
in a speculative put option investment,

950
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:36,185
and they want to hold you responsible...

951
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:38,236
for the extreme and dogmatic decision.

952
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:42,776
Uncle. The Pension and Funds Bureau.

953
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:46,866
They're your largest client
and second majority shareholder...

954
01:03:46,946 --> 01:03:48,446
with a 12-percent stake.

955
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:50,915
If they cut ties with you,

956
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:53,486
does that mean selling their stake...

957
01:03:54,086 --> 01:03:55,785
or cancelling all transactions?

958
01:03:58,156 --> 01:04:01,426
No, wait. It could be both.

959
01:04:03,196 --> 01:04:04,495
Too bad.

960
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:14,276
If Miracle were to take over...

961
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:16,676
and we appoint...

962
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,866
(Contract of Acquisition)

963
01:04:20,946 --> 01:04:22,716
an investment expert,

964
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:25,446
the worst can be avoided.

965
01:04:29,855 --> 01:04:33,125
A nephew takes the responsibility
for his uncle's shortcomings.

966
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:39,096
I like that picture.

967
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:50,535
Here you go.

968
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:55,915
- Have a coffee.
- Thank you.

969
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:05,685
Mr. Ha. I have a question.

970
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:11,825
You could've gone back to work
for Vice-Chairman Jin Dong Ki.

971
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:14,995
Why did you choose me?

972
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:19,435
I didn't make a choice.

973
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:22,875
If I were to lose this job,

974
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,946
it would only mean I'd messed up.

975
01:05:28,176 --> 01:05:31,745
Do you think anyone at Soonyang
would take me back then?

976
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:39,156
From the start, I was never allowed...

977
01:05:40,426 --> 01:05:41,656
a choice.

978
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:47,125
You were born into this family as 4-2,

979
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:49,096
so you wouldn't get it.

980
01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:51,736
I'm 4-2?

981
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:57,846
My gosh. I apologize.

982
01:06:01,276 --> 01:06:04,316
Chairman Jin's fourth son's second son.

983
01:06:05,116 --> 01:06:06,116
Is that it?

984
01:06:07,316 --> 01:06:08,355
Yes.

985
01:06:13,156 --> 01:06:14,355
That 4-2...

986
01:06:15,355 --> 01:06:17,426
asks you to do your best.

987
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:21,466
Right.

988
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:24,705
Thank you.

989
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:29,006
Move.

990
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,506
Where is Father?

991
01:06:34,046 --> 01:06:35,515
What a lovely sight.

992
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:38,285
Mom. Where is Father?

993
01:06:39,586 --> 01:06:40,665
Father!

994
01:06:40,745 --> 01:06:41,855
Dong Ki!

995
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:44,756
You, stay out of it.

996
01:06:45,526 --> 01:06:47,955
Father, where are you? Come on out!

997
01:06:48,495 --> 01:06:51,566
I have something to settle
with the old man!

998
01:06:52,026 --> 01:06:54,516
Father, I have something to say!

999
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:55,736
What's all this noise about?

1000
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:03,035
Father.

1001
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:05,645
I know everything.

1002
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:09,716
I know that...

1003
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:13,616
you're behind Do Jun. I know that now.

1004
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:16,275
Hwa Young and I,

1005
01:07:16,355 --> 01:07:19,475
the fact that we lost everything...

1006
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:21,975
to our nephew who's just a kid.

1007
01:07:22,055 --> 01:07:24,245
It makes no sense...

1008
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,446
unless you're behind him!

1009
01:07:26,526 --> 01:07:28,796
- That's enough!
- Soonyang!

1010
01:07:30,495 --> 01:07:33,236
You wanted Do Jun to take over
from the very beginning.

1011
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,506
Isn't that so? Right?

1012
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,895
Why... Why is it...

1013
01:07:39,975 --> 01:07:42,295
Why is it always me...

1014
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:47,046
Why am I always pushed to the wayside?

1015
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:50,116
My gosh...

1016
01:07:51,825 --> 01:07:56,196
How much longer must I struggle and grovel?

1017
01:07:56,625 --> 01:08:00,245
What can I do, what am I to do
to make you care about me?

1018
01:08:00,325 --> 01:08:01,636
For how long...

1019
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:06,066
How much longer must I live like this for?

1020
01:08:06,736 --> 01:08:09,805
My gosh... Father.

1021
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:18,335
Father...

1022
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:20,785
Is that all he's capable of?

1023
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:24,586
My goodness.

1024
01:08:25,955 --> 01:08:27,256
I had no idea.

1025
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,896
Father.

1026
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:35,296
Father.

1027
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,306
It's cold outside.

1028
01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:48,815
I'm burning with fury inside.

1029
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:55,256
You must sort things out for them
before it's too late.

1030
01:08:57,155 --> 01:08:59,445
Making sure the siblings stay close
is another way to protect Soonyang.

1031
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:00,655
It's only natural...

1032
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:03,945
that they resent Do Jun.

1033
01:09:04,025 --> 01:09:07,426
Hang Jae, do you also think Do Jun
is going too far?

1034
01:09:18,976 --> 01:09:20,806
What are you doing here?

1035
01:09:21,006 --> 01:09:22,615
The chairman wants to see you.

1036
01:09:28,216 --> 01:09:31,155
What? You look like you saw a ghost.

1037
01:09:32,155 --> 01:09:33,825
You didn't call ahead.

1038
01:09:34,655 --> 01:09:35,726
Get in.

1039
01:09:36,856 --> 01:09:39,495
There's somewhere we must go.

1040
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:01,886
Do you think this is allowed?

1041
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:05,506
Hwa Young and Dong Ki...

1042
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:08,025
are your aunt and uncle.

1043
01:10:09,695 --> 01:10:10,995
They're my kids.

1044
01:10:12,525 --> 01:10:14,025
Your father's siblings.

1045
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,966
Must you go to the very end?

1046
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:23,506
If need be.

1047
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:25,875
What?

1048
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:28,745
I guess I'm like you.

1049
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:33,346
I have three extra things in here.

1050
01:10:33,785 --> 01:10:37,216
They're full of greed, suspicion,
and change of mind.

1051
01:10:38,186 --> 01:10:39,226
That's three.

1052
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:02,815
What?

1053
01:11:05,186 --> 01:11:06,186
Are you sure?

1054
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:10,016
Father...

1055
01:11:11,386 --> 01:11:12,856
is with Do Jun?

1056
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:16,346
- What?
- A press conference is scheduled.

1057
01:11:16,426 --> 01:11:17,785
Reporters from TV stations
and the major papers...

1058
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:20,125
are waiting for the chairman to arrive.

1059
01:11:23,495 --> 01:11:00,566
He's going to make it official.

1060
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:28,806
Without even a word to us.

1061
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,125
(Soonyang History Museum)

1062
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:33,566
- Where's the chairman?
- What's going on?

1063
01:11:33,646 --> 01:11:36,066
- Can you tell us what it's about?
- What do you know?

1064
01:11:36,146 --> 01:11:37,235
Any comments, sir?

1065
01:11:37,315 --> 01:11:39,806
Calm down, please, everyone.

1066
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:41,586
This press conference is about...

1067
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,856
Soonyang Financial Holding Company's
establishment.

1068
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:46,905
We'll begin as soon as the chairman arrives
which will be shortly.

1069
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:48,325
Please bear with us.

1070
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:50,846
Is it true the holding company
is to decide who his heir will be?

1071
01:11:50,926 --> 01:11:52,115
Has he decided on someone?

1072
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:54,115
Will the new CEO become his successor?

1073
01:11:54,195 --> 01:11:56,565
- Please tell us.
- Come on, now.

1074
01:11:57,165 --> 01:12:00,436
Please ask those questions
to the chairman himself.

1075
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,235
Do Jun, how about you run it?

1076
01:12:06,676 --> 01:12:07,705
Pardon?

1077
01:12:10,546 --> 01:12:12,016
Soonyang Financial Group.

1078
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:16,415
I'm going to give it to you.

1079
01:12:45,586 --> 01:12:48,186
Now, I know the reason why...

1080
01:12:50,586 --> 01:12:52,926
I remember nothing about 4-2, Jin Do Jun.

1081
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:54,995
(Jin Do Jun, 4-2, Deceased)

1082
01:12:56,495 --> 01:01:58,016 NO CHANGE NEEDED

1083
01:12:58,096 --> 01:12:59,695
It's because I died.

1084
01:13:03,665 --> 01:13:04,705
And...

1085
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:12,405
things that are bound to happen...

1086
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:14,306
always happen, without fail.

1087
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:22,686
